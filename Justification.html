          <h2><center> Justification of Game </center></h2>
          <p> The reason why I have chosen to evaluate Elite Dangerous's UI is because it has been designed to work well both in VR and on a screen.
              It also has slightly different approach to UIs than most other games.

              Elite Dangerous is designed to be a very immersive game, and the UI is very important to keep the player immersed.

          </p>

          <h2><center> Justification of Evaluation methods </center></h2>

          <p> I chose to use Heuristic Analysis to evaluate Elites UI because it covers most of the key areas that make up a good UI
          </p>

          <p> I chose to use a Survey to gather information about how easy the UI was to navigate for other people.
          </P>


          <h2><center> Conclusion about UI </center></h2>

          <p>
          The UI in Elite: Dangerous is well designed for it's purpose of immersing the player within the game,
          however there are a lot of elements that can be very confusing to the player and it could be made easier by having some control options and instructions that appear when the player first starts the game.
        </p>

        <p>
          Furthermore the aesthetic design of the UI is very clean and easy on the eyes.
          But there is little in the way of customisation, and in order to change the UI colour the player has to edit the XML files within the game files.
          The player should be able to change this within the game.
        </p>
