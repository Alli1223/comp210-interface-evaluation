          <h4> Heuristics for Interface Analysis</h4>
            <h5>Visibility of System Status</h5>
              <p>
                Elite displays most of the vital system information on the main front window, such as ship shield status, power distribution, ship health and comms etc..

                However there is still quite a lot of vital information that is rather hard to access quickly.
              </p>


            <h5> User Control and Freedom </h5>
              <p>
                Elites UI does not have much control and freedom, for example if the user presses the "eject all cargo" key, there is no confirmation.
              </p>

            <h5>Recognition Rather than Recall</h5>
              <p>
                This is where Elites UI could have a lot of improvements to it.
                For example:
              </p>

              <img src="https://github.com/Alli1223/comp210-interface-evaluation/blob/gh-pages/images/Elite_Screenshots/Recall.jpg?raw=true" alt="Elite Dangerous UI" style="width:400px">
              <p>
                This image shows the shield status as a set of rings around the ship, this is not clear as to what it actually does.
              </p>


            <h5>Flexibility and Efficiency of Use</h5>

            <p>
              The navigation of the UI is fairly simple, There are a set of tabs at the top of the UI and each tab contains a set of information about a specific part of the game.
              All the UI navigation can be done via the keyboard, as there is no mouse in the game. This can be confusing for new players as navigating the UI can be challenging without a mouse.

              Furthermore some of the key functionality of the game can be quite hard to find and activate, for example the Landing Gear and External Lights on the far tab, as the image below shows.
            </p>

              <img src="https://github.com/Alli1223/comp210-interface-evaluation/blob/gh-pages/images/Elite_Screenshots/RightUI1.jpg?raw=true" alt="Elite Dangerous UI" style="width:600">

              <p>

              </p>

            <h5>Aesthetic and Minimalist Design</h5>

            <p>
               Most of Elites UI is kept fairly clean, allowing most of the players vision to be focused on the game.

               Some of the tabs could be combined because I find that I spend a lot of time cycling through the tabs to try and find the right one.

            </p>

            <h5>Consistency and Standards</h5>
            The UI has consistant design elements,

            <h5>Help and Documentation</h5>
            There is little in the way of help within the actual game, and there is a steep learning curve for a lot of the elements
