          <p> Note that this heuristic evaluation was done by me, and not by another person. So there may be bias associated with some of the results presented below. </p>
          <h4> Heuristics for Interface Analysis</h4>
            <h5>Visibility of System Status</h5>
              <p>
                Elite displays most of the vital system information on the main front window, such as ship shield status, power distribution, ship health and comms etc..

                However there is still quite a lot of vital information that is rather hard to access quickly.
              </p>


            <h5> User Control and Freedom </h5>
              <p>
                Elites UI does not have much control and freedom, for example if the user presses the "eject all cargo" key, there is no confirmation message that gets displayed. This means the user can accedintly loose hours of work by accidentally pressing the wrong key on the keyboard.
              </p>

            <h5>Recognition Rather than Recall</h5>
              <p>


                For example:
              </p>

              <img src="https://github.com/Alli1223/comp210-interface-evaluation/blob/gh-pages/images/Elite_Screenshots/Recall.jpg?raw=true" alt="Elite Dangerous UI" style="width:400px">
              <p>
                This image shows the shield status as a set of rings around the ship, this is not clear as to what it actually does.

              </p>

            <h5>Flexibility and Efficiency of Use</h5>

            <p>
              The navigation of the UI is fairly simple, There are a set of tabs at the top of the UI and each tab contains a set of information about a specific part of the game.
              All the UI navigation in the ship is done via the keyboard. This can be confusing for new players as navigating the UI can be challenging without a mouse, also there is are instructions on how to navigate the menus.

              Furthermore some of the key functionality of the game can be quite hard to find and activate, for example the Landing Gear and External Lights on the far tab, as the image below shows.
            </p>

            <img src="https://github.com/Alli1223/comp210-interface-evaluation/blob/gh-pages/images/Elite_Screenshots/RightUI1.jpg?raw=true" alt="Elite Dangerous UI" style="width:600">

            <p>

            </p>

            <h5>Aesthetic and Minimalist Design</h5>

            <p>
               Most of Elites UI is kept fairly clean, allowing most of the players vision to be focused on the game.

               Some of the tabs could be combined because I find that I spend a lot of time cycling through the tabs to try and find the right one.
             </p>
             <p>

               Furthermore some of the design is a bit too simple and it takes players a while to understand what some UI elements represent.
               For example the image below shows a circle with a blue dot in it, that blue dot shows where the targeted ship or item is located in relation to where your ship is facing.
             </p>

               <img src="https://github.com/Alli1223/comp210-interface-evaluation/blob/gh-pages/images/Elite_Screenshots/Minimalist_Design.jpg?raw=true" alt"Elite Minimist design" style="width:600">

            <p>
                 This is not made clear to the player at all, and the player has to try and work it out for themselves.
            </p>

            <h5>Consistency and Standards</h5>
            <p>
              The UI has consistant design elements as all the menus have the same layout and design.
              This means that when you learn how to navigate one of the menus, all the other menus are very easy to understand.
            </p>

            <p>

            </p>
            <h5>Help and Documentation</h5>
            <p>
            There is little in the way of help within the actual game, and there is a steep learning curve for a lot of the elements.

            However the game does have a "Preflight-checks" option that means that the player has to learn the movement contols of the ship before they can take off.
